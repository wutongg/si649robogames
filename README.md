# si649robogames
The server directory has the server implementation

The client directory has example clients and a web interface to modify the guesses during a running game

Detailed instructions for Robogames can be found [here][1]. 

The main goal for this project is to build a dashboard to help our team recruit productive robots as many as possible during 10 minutes.

This dashboard was built based on [Altair][2] libaray using Python, and we used [Streamlit][3] to implement our dashboard.
